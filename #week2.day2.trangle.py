#Create pseudo code and Python source code, that calculates the perimeter of a triangle. 
# Answer is found in Appendix B:
#  Calculate triangle perimeter


# Get first side 
# Get second side 
# Get third side 
# Add sides 
# Display total

side1 = int(input("enter first side: ")) 
side2 = int(input("enter first side: ")) 
side3 = int(input("enter first side: ")) 
total = side1 + side2 + side3 
print("Triangle perimeter is :", total)
